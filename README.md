## 📌 Problem Statement

In educational institutions, reporting and managing facility issues (electricity failures, water supply problems, WiFi downtime, cleanliness concerns, etc.) is often **slow, inefficient, and non-transparent**.  

Students face delays in getting their problems resolved due to the lack of a centralized system.  
Administrators struggle with **tracking, prioritizing, and assigning issues** effectively.
